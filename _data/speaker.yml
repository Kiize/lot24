  title: ""
  bio: "After completing his studies at the “Liceo Scientifico E. Fermi” in San Marcello P.se, Giulio enrolled in Pisa at the faculty of physics, where he got his degree in Physics in 2022 with a thesis on the Thermal conductivity of GeSn films. He continued his studies on condensed matter physics with an interest in crystalline and solid systems. On his free time he can be found hiking in the mountains around Pisa or coordinating the activities of the local committee of AISF."

  bio: "Born in Vibo Valentia (Calabria) on March 11, 1998, Ismaele got his scientific diploma at “Liceo Scientifico G. Berto” in Vibo Valentia. After that he graduated at the University of Calabria with a thesis on the Mathematical aspect of GUP models in Quantum Mechanics, and now he's studying Theoretical Physics in Pisa, with a deep focus on Quantum Gravity and Algebraic Topology. Besides physics his other passions are: reading books, listening and playing music (piano and guitar), cooking and history of sports in general."

  title: "Taming waves with metamaterials and metasurfaces."
  bio: "Simone Zanotto is a Permanent Researcher at the Nanoscience Institute (CNR-NANO).<\br>After obtaining the Degree of Physics at the University of Pavia (2009), he joined the NEST Labs (Pisa) as PhD student of Scuola Normale Superiore, earning the degree in 2014. Subsequently he stayed at Polifab – Politecnico di Milano (2014-2015) and at LENS Laboratory (Firenze, 2016) as research scientist.<\br>His scientific production spanned from nanophotonics for photovoltaics, to quantum light-matter interaction (intersubband polaritons), through tunable photonics based on transition metal oxides and responsive polymers.<\br>Since 2018 he is serving as Co-Teacher of the Laboratory of Physics of Matter and Nanotechnology at University of Pisa."

#  title: "Towards combining lasers and gene editing via plasmonics"
#  bio: "Francesco Fuso è Professore Associato presso il Dipartimento di Fisica Enrico Fermi, Università di Pisa. I suoi interessi di ricerca coprono una vasta gamma di applicazioni laser alla tecnologia, alla microscopia avanzata, alla scienza dei materiali. È autore di oltre 160 pubblicazioni su riviste internazionali peer-reviewed e di oltre 50 partecipazioni a conferenze scientifiche.<br/>
#  È stato coinvolto in diversi progetti di ricerca finanziati da istituzioni nazionali e internazionali, è membro del comitato editoriale di Materials Research Express (IOP, Bristol) e Biosensors (MDPI, Basel), è stato nominato Outstanding Referee dall'American Physical Society nel 2021 È stato Vice Direttore del Dipartimento di Fisica e Vice Coordinatore della Scuola di Dottorato in Fisica dell'Università di Pisa."
#  abstract: "Laser light finds a huge array of applications. Some of them entail selective transfer of energy that can be used, for instance, to increase temperature at the very local scale. When illuminated by suitable light pulses, metal nanoparticles featuring localized plasmon resonances can play the game. An experiment is discussed where metal nanoparticles are attached to selected sites in a DNA strand, with the aim to promote controlled cleavage of the DNA upon laser illumination. Ambition of the approach is to add a laser control to the CRISPR method, a recently introduced biotechnology aimed at gene editing."
