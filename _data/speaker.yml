  title: ""
  bio: "After completing his studies at the “Liceo Scientifico E. Fermi” in San Marcello P.se, Giulio enrolled in Pisa at the faculty of physics, where he got his degree in Physics in 2022 with a thesis on the Thermal conductivity of GeSn films. He continued his studies on condensed matter physics with an interest in crystalline and solid systems. On his free time he can be found hiking in the mountains around Pisa or coordinating the activities of the local committee of AISF."

  bio: "Born in Vibo Valentia (Calabria) on March 11, 1998, Ismaele got his scientific diploma at “Liceo Scientifico G. Berto” in Vibo Valentia. After that he graduated at the University of Calabria with a thesis on the Mathematical aspect of GUP models in Quantum Mechanics, and now he's studying Theoretical Physics in Pisa, with a deep focus on Quantum Gravity and Algebraic Topology. Besides physics his other passions are: reading books, listening and playing music (piano and guitar), cooking and history of sports in general."

  title: "Taming waves with metamaterials and metasurfaces."
  bio: "Simone Zanotto is a Permanent Researcher at the Nanoscience Institute (CNR-NANO). After obtaining the Degree of Physics at the University of Pavia (2009), he joined the NEST Labs (Pisa) as PhD student of Scuola Normale Superiore, earning the degree in 2014. Subsequently he stayed at Polifab – Politecnico di Milano (2014-2015) and at LENS Laboratory (Firenze, 2016) as research scientist.<br/>His scientific production spanned from nanophotonics for photovoltaics, to quantum light-matter interaction (intersubband polaritons), through tunable photonics based on transition metal oxides and responsive polymers.<br/>Since 2018 he is serving as Co-Teacher of the Laboratory of Physics of Matter and Nanotechnology at University of Pisa."

  title: "Exploring the supersolid phase of matter with an atomic quantum simulator"
  bio: "Luca Tanzi is a Senior Researcher at the National Research Council (CNR), where he studies fundamental physical phenomena with an ultracold quantum gas experiment. After graduating in Physics from the University of Milan, he obtained his Ph.D. in Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy from the LENS Laboratory of the University of Florence in 2014.<br/> He then carried out research activities in various European institutes, including ICFO (Barcelona) and the National Institute of Optics (INO), Pisa section. He has conducted cutting-edge experiments on disordered quantum systems, quantum mixtures and dipolar quantum gases. His main scientific discoveries are: the observation of a 'quantum droplet' regime in mixtures of quantum gases, and the experimental observation of the so-called supersolid, a paradoxical state of matter that combines two natures in one: that of the solid (rigid structure) and that of the superfluid (fluid without friction)."
